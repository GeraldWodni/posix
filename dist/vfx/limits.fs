\ This file has been generated using SWIG and fsi,
\ and is already platform dependent, search for the corresponding
\ fsi-file to compile it where no one has compiled it before ;)
\ Forth systems have their own own dynamic loader and don't need addional C-Code.
\ That's why this file will just print normal forth-code once compiled
\ and can be used directly with include or require.
